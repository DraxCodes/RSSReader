    <title>Goodbye to Patriot Act, a comedy show that was a different kind of angry</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;p id="ylm0rv"&gt;If you want to watch a TV show that recaps the latest news with a healthy amount of jokes and comically bad photoshops, you have a lot of choices. There’s &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;With Trevor Noah&lt;/em&gt; on Comedy Central, TBS’s &lt;em&gt;Full Frontal with Samantha Bee&lt;/em&gt;, and HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Last Week Tonight&lt;/em&gt; w&lt;em&gt;ith John Oliver.&lt;/em&gt; This week, however, there is one less option: Netflix has canceled &lt;em&gt;Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj&lt;/em&gt;, a show that superficially didn’t seem all that different from its competitors, but with each half-hour installment, it proved itself among the best. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="RSay9a"&gt;In 2020, it can be hard to watch these shows. As clever as the jokes can be and as deep as they can dig to surface under-seen issues, current events have become unimaginably bleak, and the United States’...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel Buds are now available in more colors nearly four months after launch</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aBBqzPq04NXmNF1A5kX_LIAuvlg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67233911/DSCF7977.0.jpg" /&gt;


      &lt;p id="Y6QqKz"&gt;Google has finally launched more colors for its second-generation Pixel Buds, nearly four months since the true wireless headphones launched. In addition to “clearly white,” you can now buy the Pixel Buds in “oh so orange,” “quite mint,” and “almost black.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="OLA8NC"&gt;The second-generation Pixel Buds launched on April 27th, but they were only available in white at the time, despite Google also announcing the other three colors when the Pixel Buds were revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908079/google-pixel-buds-2-earbuds-hands-on-photo-video-wireless-features-bluetooth"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. My colleague Chris Welch found &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21237660/google-pixel-buds-2-2020-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; that the new Pixel Buds had a much-improved design over their predecessor (which were connected by a wire) but only an average battery life and weaker bass than their competitors. After the headphones launched, though, some users...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adobe accidentally deleted people’s photos in latest Lightroom update</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Adobe Lightroom logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OecpCrJgQ7tvrcfY0O8-3Oj7_TA=/3x0:3197x2129/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67233877/1208999496.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

      &lt;p id="SafaHU"&gt;For the past two days, photographers have been posting in a panic across Twitter, Reddit, and the Photoshop feedback forums. They’d downloaded Adobe’s latest update for Lightroom’s iOS app, and suddenly, their photos and presets were gone. Adobe has now confirmed the issue, and it’s also said that the data are gone for good. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="FtwbuI"&gt;“I’ve talked with customer service for 4+ hours over the past 2 days and just a minute ago they told me that the issue has no fix and that these lost photos are unrecoverable,” complained one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Lightroom/comments/icz90f/i_cant_believe_i_lost_2_years_of_edits_due_to_the/"&gt;Reddit user&lt;/a&gt; who says they’ve lost over two years’ worth of photo edits. The complaints were spotted by &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2020/08/20/lightroom-app-update-wipes-users-photos-and-presets-adobe-says-they-are-not-recoverable/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PetaPixel+%28PetaPixel%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PetaPixel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="mVuyEj"&gt;“This is literally the worst,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/llambert89/status/1296462982965334017"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; another customer, who said they lost not only 800 pictures but hundreds of...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb puts global ban on house parties to support social distancing guidelines</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Airbnb logo is seen displayed..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JD6xJYlX8dSBrTcuAlvopPUE_oo=/0x3:4000x2670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67233832/1208943691.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

      &lt;p id="v2Uhbu"&gt;Airbnb is cracking down on house parties and events in properties listed on its platform to try to better follow local health departments’ social distancing requirements for large gatherings, the &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-global-party-ban/"&gt;company said in a blog post Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s imposing an occupancy cap of 16 people, and hosts or renters on the platform who try to evade the new rules risk being banned from the platform or even the possibility of legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="Xmjrqu"&gt;With local health departments reacting to the coronavirus cases in their areas, many implemented restrictions on the number of people allowed in bars and restaurants. Airbnb said it found people were taking “bar and club behavior” to homes rented on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="01qUfC"&gt;“We think such conduct is incredibly irresponsible — we...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft will suspend its ride-hailing service in California</title>
    <content type="html">
      &lt;img alt="Lyft Reports Quarterly Earnings" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DC8cs3zV9XgcmlTJFaV8luSV448=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67233548/1265683478.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

      &lt;small&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/small&gt;

      &lt;p id="xeGxHC"&gt;Lyft will suspend its ride-hailing operations in California at 11:59PM PT on August 20th, the company confirmed in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Fblog%2Fposts%2Fca-operations-update&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F8%2F20%2F21377493%2Flyft-california-suspend-ride-hailing-service-drivers-ab5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Along with Uber, the company was ordered by a state judge to employ its drivers rather than classify them as independent contractors. But Lyft is choosing to end its service in California rather than comply with that order — at least for now. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="eruaBB"&gt;“This is not something we wanted to do, as we know millions of Californians depend on Lyft for daily, essential trips,” the company writes. “We’re personally reaching out to riders and drivers to share more about why this is happening, what you can do about it, and to provide some transportation alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id="VDNS3N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376009/uber-ceo-interivew-california-ab5-drivers-khosrowshahi"&gt;Uber has also said it will cease operations in California&lt;/a&gt; at...&lt;/p&gt;
